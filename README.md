#Your approach to solving the problem
Every detail, I used Figma template and took a look at the Goldenset's website to make my design vibe with its style. Then build the basic structure, the big picture of this assignment, and I took a deeper and detailed look at the generated code then modify some.

#2 How much AI did you use?

I used Claude to help me organize the requirements and write a more clear specs add my own thoughts, then generate prompt for AI coding tool, let it generate the basic code file as a foundation, then I took a deeper and detailed look at its codes and modify them. When there are issues I was not sure about. The UI/UX design was 100% done by me for human user experiences and personal aesthetic concern.

I put my thinking mainly in the spec, the design and reviewing AI generated big picture code then modify it as I wanted.

#3 In your opinion, where are the places you could do better?

interact with login, and for the password i reckon can do a dynamic validation to see if user's password fit the requirement.
