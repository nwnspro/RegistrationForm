# Quick Reference - For Interview

## 🚀 One-Minute Setup

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Run tests (should see 69 passing)
npm run test:run
```

**Expected output**: ✅ `Test Files 2 passed (2)` | ✅ `Tests 69 passed (69)`

## 🎯 The 4 Form States (Lines 12-64 in RegistrationForm.tsx)

| State | Visual | When | Code Line |
|-------|--------|------|-----------|
| **1. IDLE** | No banner, no errors | Initial load | Lines 60-63 |
| **2. WARNING** | Inline errors only | Field blur with error | Lines 60-63 (returns null) |
| **3. FAILURE** | Banner + inline errors | Submit invalid form | Lines 40-58 |
| **4. SUCCESS** | Success page | API success | Lines 375-394 |

## 🧪 Prove Tests Work

### Quick Test (30 seconds):
```bash
# 1. Comment out line 160 in RegistrationForm.tsx
# const gmailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@gmail\.com$/;

# 2. Run tests - 2 will fail
npm run test:run

# 3. Uncomment line 160 - all pass again
npm run test:run
```

## 📝 Key Comments in Code

Every critical line has:
```typescript
// TESTED BY: Lines X-Y in test file
// WILL FAIL IF: You remove/modify this code
```

**Example** (line 160):
```typescript
// TESTED BY: Lines 710-723, Line 58-88 (non-Gmail rejection)
const gmailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@gmail\.com$/;
if (!gmailRegex.test(trimmedEmail))
  return { text: "Must be a Gmail address", isWarning: true };
```

If you delete this, tests on lines 710-723 WILL FAIL ❌

## 💡 Common Interview Questions

### Q: "Where are the 4 states?"
**A**: "Lines 12-64 in RegistrationForm.tsx - FormStatusComponent. Each state is documented with when it appears and which tests validate it."

### Q: "How do I know tests actually work?"
**A**: "Comment out line 160 (Gmail validation) and run `npm run test:run`. Two tests will fail immediately."

### Q: "Which test validates the Gmail check?"
**A**: "Line 160 has comment 'TESTED BY: Lines 710-723'. That's the test."

### Q: "What happens if I remove the FAILURE banner?"
**A**: "Lines 42-48. If you delete this, test on line 88 'shows FAILURE state when submitting empty form' will fail."

2. **Type valid data** → Banner disappears (IDLE)
3. **Blur email with error** → See inline error (WARNING)
4. **Submit valid data** → See "All set!" page (SUCCESS)
